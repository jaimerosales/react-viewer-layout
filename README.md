Personal React Template to use Forge Viewer with your own logo. 

This is using Autodesk Forge Viewer, it is a simple template that I'm using in my samples, if you are familiar with the platform, you know you will need a translated URN that needs to be replaced in the Viewer.js, dcoumentId Var. You can refer to this also if you don't have one and will like to explore it.

The setup process is pretty straight forward.

	Clone the repo
	cd into the repo
	npm install
	export FORGE_CLIENT_ID=<>
	export FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<>
	npm run watch (this will load your hot reloading capability)
